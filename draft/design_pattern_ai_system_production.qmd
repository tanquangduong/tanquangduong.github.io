When building an LLM-based agentic chatbot for production, several design patterns and elements should be considered:
Guardrails: Implement safety controls to monitor and dictate user interactions with the LLM application. This ensures the AI model operates within defined principles and organizational guidelines2.
Multi-Agent Systems (MAS): Utilize a system of specialized LLM agents for different tasks, such as a reflector, document checker, web searcher, critic, and coder. This approach can improve performance and accuracy compared to a single chatbot3.
Agentic Design Patterns:
Supervision: Use a Supervisor (Router) agent to manage Worker/Specialist agents4.
Reflection: Prompt the LLM to critique its past actions for improvement4.
Collaboration: Enable agents to share common memories and work together as specialists4.
Agent Components:
Planner: Creates step-by-step plans by decomposing complex tasks4.
Memory: Stores conversation history and learned context4.
Tools: Enables the agent to call external APIs or functions4.
Specialization: Focus on building specialized agents for specific tasks rather than general-purpose ones. This approach often leads to better performance and reliability4.
Evaluation Pipeline: Implement a proper evaluation system with clearly defined goals to assess and improve agent performance4.
Rate Limiting: As you mentioned, implement rate limiting to manage API calls and prevent overuse or abuse of the system.
Composability: Design agents as functions that can be combined and reused in various configurations5.
Error Handling and Fallbacks: Implement robust error handling mechanisms and fallback options for when the LLM fails to provide satisfactory responses.
Scalability: Design the system to handle increasing loads and user interactions efficiently.
Monitoring and Logging: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging systems to track performance, errors, and user interactions.
Privacy and Security: Ensure proper data handling, encryption, and compliance with relevant regulations.
By considering these design patterns and elements, you can create a more robust, efficient, and reliable LLM-based agentic chatbot for production use.
