I am thrilled to introduce my Udemy course **Hands-On Generative AI Engineering with Large Language Model**.

This course equips you with a wide range of tools, frameworks, and techniques to create your GenAI applications using Large Language Models, including Python, PyTorch, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Hugging Face, FAISS, Chroma, Tavily, Streamlit, Gradio, FastAPI, Docker, and more.

This hands-on course covers essential topics such as implementing Transformers from scratch, fine-tuning Transformer models for downstream tasks, prompt engineering, vector embeddings, vector stores, and creating cutting-edge AI applications like AI Assistants, Chatbots, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, autonomous agents, and serving your GenAI applications from scratch using REST APIs and Docker containerization.

By the end of this course, you will have the practical skills and theoretical knowledge needed to develop and serving your own LLM-based applications.

If you are interested in these above topics, checking it out.
