    "text": "Large language models (LLMs) are initially trained on vast amounts of unlabeled data to acquire broad general knowledge. However, this pretraining approach has limitations for specialized tasks like Question Answering (QA) due to the facts like (1) The next-token prediction objective used in pretraining is not directly aligned with targeted tasks like QA. (2) General knowledge may be insufficient for domain-specific applications requiring specialized expertise. (3) Publicly available pretraining data may lack up-to-date or proprietary information needed for certain use cases.\nThose senarios are where Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) comes into play. It addresses these limitations by adapting pretrained LLMs for specific downstream tasks, by (1) enabling models to learn task-specific patterns and nuances, (2) incorporating domain knowledge not present in general pretraining data, (3) improving performance on targeted applications like QA",

    "text": "SFT Pipeline Components\nThe SFT pipeline consists of several key stages and components, illustrated in the following flowchart: \n\nInputs: Including a raw dataset comprising task-specific examples, along with a pretrained base language model.\nInstruction-Dataset Preparation: In this phase, the raw data undergoes a process of refinement and structuring. This stage involves data cleaning and filtering, which ensures the removal of irrelevant, inconsistent, or low-quality examples. Following this, the generation of instruction-answer pairs takes place, transforming the dataset into a form conducive to instructional tasks and allowing the model to learn through guided examples that are relevant to its intended applications.\nDataset Formatting: During this phase, the prepared data is converted into standardized formats to maintain consistency across diverse implementations. These formats include widely-used structures such as JSON configurations modeled on popular frameworks like Alpaca, ShareGPT, and OpenAI formats. Additionally, examples are organized with the aid of structured chat templates, such as those derived from Alpaca, ChatML, and Llama 3, further enhancing the model’s ability to engage in coherent, context-aware dialogues.\nCore SFT Process: This stage builds on the well-structured data to fine-tune the base model. During this stage, the model is trained on the formatted instruction dataset using advanced SFT methodologies. Techniques like full fine-tuning, LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), or QLoRA (Quantized LoRA) are employed to optimize the model’s performance while preserving efficiency and adaptability.\nOutput: At the final stage, we will obtain task-specific fine-tuned model.\n\nThis pipeline allows for systematic adaptation of LLMs to targeted applications while leveraging their pretrained knowledge.\nNote that the formatted instruction datasets and chat templates provide a unified way to present diverse training examples to the model. If we fine-tune the pretrained base model, we can choose any chat templates. However, if we fine-tune an instruct model, we need to use the sample template.",

    "text": "SFT techniques\nThere are three main types of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for large language models:\n\nFull Model Fine-Tuning. This approach involves updating all parameters of the pre-trained model. It offers maximum flexibility in adapting the model to specialized tasks. It often yields significant performance improvements but requires substantial computational resources.\nFeature-Based Fine-Tuning. This method focuses on extracting features from the pre-trained model and used as input for another model or classifier. The main pre-trained model remains unchanged. It’s less resource-intensive and provides faster results, making it suitable when computational power is limited.\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). PEFT techniques aim to fine-tune models more efficiently. Only a portion of the model’s weights are modified, leaving the fundamental language understanding intact. It adds task-specific layers or adapters to the pre-trained model. Significantly reduces computational costs compared to full fine-tuning while still achieving competitive performance.\n\nThe choice between these approaches is often based on the specific requirements of the task, available computational resources, and desired model performance.\nIn this article, we will discuss more about the two most popular and effective PEFT techniques: LoRA and QLoRA.",

    "section": "PEFT with LoRA and QLoRA",
    "text": "PEFT with LoRA and QLoRA\nLoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is introduced in 2021 in the paper “LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models” by Adward et al.. It then has gained widespread adoption. It is a cost-effective and efficient method for adapting pretrained language models to specific tasks by freezing most of the model’s parameters and updating only a small number of task-specific weights. This approach leverages adapters to reduce the training overhead, making it an attractive solution for limited compute scenarios.\nQLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) is an extension of the LoRA technique. It is proposed in the paper “QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs” by Tim et al. in 2023. It quantizes the weight of each pretrained parameter to 4 bits (from the typical 32 bits). This results in significant memory savings and enables running large language models on a single GPU\nWhen deciding between LoRA and QLoRA for fine-tuning large language models, key considerations revolve around hardware, model size, speed, and accuracy needs.\nLoRA generally requires more GPU memory than QLoRA but is more efficient than full fine-tuning, making it suitable for systems with moderate to high GPU memory capacity. QLoRA, on the other hand, significantly lowers memory demands, making it more suitable for devices with limited memory resources. While LoRA is often faster, QLoRA incurs slight speed trade-offs due to quantization steps but offers superior memory efficiency, enabling fine-tuning of larger models on constrained hardware.\nAccuracy and computational efficiency also differ between the two methods. LoRA typically yields stable and precise results, whereas QLoRA’s use of quantization may lead to minor accuracy losses, though it can sometimes reduce overfitting. When it comes to specific needs, LoRA is ideal if preserving full model precision is vital, whereas QLoRA shines for extremely large models or environments with tight memory constraints. QLoRA also supports varying levels of quantization (e.g., 8-bit, 4-bit, or even 2-bit), adding flexibility but at the cost of increased implementation complexity.\nTo implement LoRA and QLoRA in practice, among other frameworks like PEFT/Bitsandbytes (Hugging Face), TorchTune, Axolotl, …, we use the Unsloth framework in this article. This is an innovative open-source framework designed to revolutionize the fine-tuning and training of large language models. So it is worth to discuss more about Unsloth in the next section.",

I have prepared this dataset in my previsous post, if you have not read it yet, I recommend you to check it out.

    "text": "Fine-Tuning Implementation\nTo achieve the fine-tuning, we will utilize the following libraries and methods:\n1. Import Necessary Libraries\nimport os\nimport comet_ml\nimport torch\nfrom trl import SFTTrainer\nfrom datasets import load_dataset, concatenate_datasets\nfrom transformers import TrainingArguments, TextStreamer\nfrom unsloth import FastLanguageModel, is_bfloat16_supported\nfrom google.colab import userdata\n2. Comet ML Login\nWe leverage Comet ML for real-time monitoring and tracking our fine-tuning experiments. Comet ML allows you to automatically track a wide range of metrics, parameters, and artifacts during the model training process. This includes training loss, gradient norms, hyperparameters, code versions, and more.\nIn addition, Comet ML makes it easy to compare different experiments, helping you understand how changes in code, hyperparameters, or data affect model performance. The platform provides workspaces and sharing capabilities, enabling teams to collaborate more effectively on ML projects. To dicover more about its features and benefits, please check out Comet ML’s website.\ncomet_ml.login(project_name=\"sft-lora-unsloth\")\n3. Load Pretrained Model and Tokenizer\nNext, we use FastLanguageModel class from Unsloth with the .from_pretrained() method to load Qwen2.5-3B model and its corresponding tokenizer. We specify the max sequence length as 2048 in this use-case. Then, the load_in_4bit argument indicates if we want to use QLoRA (assign True), else LoRA.\nmax_seq_length = 2048\nmodel, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(\n    model_name=\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B\",\n    max_seq_length=max_seq_length,\n    load_in_4bit=False,\n    )\n4. Apply LoRA Adaptation\nThen, we set up LoRA configurations for our loaded model, including the rank r as 32, alpha as 32, no dropout and target modules as linear layers. This is where leveraging experiment tracking and comparison, we can apply hyperparameter tuning to find out the best set of parameters.\nmodel = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(\n    model,\n    r=32,\n    lora_alpha=32,\n    lora_dropout=0,\n    target_modules=[\"q_proj\", \"k_proj\", \"v_proj\", \"up_proj\", \"down_proj\", \"o_proj\", \"gate_proj\"],\n    )\n5. Formatting Dataset\nNext, we need to load, format and map the instruction dataset into a specific text template, using Alpaca template in this example.\n# Get Instruction Dataset\ndataset = load_dataset(\"tanquangduong/TinyStories_Instruction\", split=\"train\")\n\n# Template for formatting instruction-output pairs following Alpaca dataset format\nalpaca_template = \"\"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task.\nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request.\n### Instruction:\n{}\n### Response:\n{}\"\"\"\n\n# Get the end of sequence token from the tokenizer\nEOS_TOKEN = tokenizer.eos_token\n\ndef format_samples(examples):\n    \"\"\"\n    Format instruction-output pairs into training samples.\n    Args:\n        examples: Dictionary containing 'instruction' and 'output' lists\n    Returns:\n        Dictionary with formatted 'text' list\n    \"\"\"\n    text = []\n    # Zip instruction-output pairs together and format each pair\n    for instruction, output in zip(examples[\"instruction\"], examples[\"output\"], strict=False):\n        # Insert instruction & output into template and append EOS token\n        message = alpaca_template.format(instruction, output) + EOS_TOKEN\n        text.append(message)\n\n    return {\"text\": text}\n\n# Apply formatting to entire dataset:\n# - Process in batches for efficiency\n# - Remove original columns since they're now formatted into 'text'\ndataset = dataset.map(format_samples, batched=True, remove_columns=dataset.column_names)\n6. Setting Up the Trainer and Lauching the Training\nWhen the instruction dataset is formatted and prepared, and the model is loaded with adapted parameters and architectures (e.g., LoRA or QLoRA), we utilize the SFTTrainer class from the TRL library for supervised fine-tuning.\ntrainer = SFTTrainer(\n    model=model,\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,\n    train_dataset=dataset[\"train\"],\n    eval_dataset=dataset[\"test\"],\n    dataset_text_field=\"text\",\n    max_seq_length=max_seq_length,\n    dataset_num_proc=2,\n    packing=True,\n    args=TrainingArguments(\n        learning_rate=1e-5,\n        lr_scheduler_type=\"linear\",\n        per_device_train_batch_size=2,\n        per_device_eval_batch_size=2,\n        gradient_accumulation_steps=8,\n        num_train_epochs=3,\n        fp16=not is_bfloat16_supported(),\n        bf16=is_bfloat16_supported(),\n        logging_steps=1,\n        optim=\"adamw_8bit\",\n        weight_decay=0.01,\n        warmup_steps=10,\n        output_dir=\"output\",\n        report_to=\"comet_ml\",\n        seed=0,\n        ),\n    )\ntrainer.train()\n7. Experiment tracking\nDuring training, we can track the training loss or other metrics using the Comet ML platform. The plots should look like the following:\n\n\n\nML Experiment Tracking using Comet ML\n\n\n8. Model Inference\nWhen the fine-tuning is finished, we can perform a quick test on the fine-tuned model.\n# Switch model to inference mode (disables training-specific components)\nFastLanguageModel.for_inference(model)\n\n# Format the story prompt using Alpaca template\nmessage = alpaca_template.format(\"Write a story about a humble little bunny \\\nnamed Ben who follows a mysterious trail in the woods, \\\ndiscovering beautiful flowers, new friends, and a lovely pond along the way.\", \"\")\n\n# Convert text to tokens, create PyTorch tensors, and move to GPU\ninputs = tokenizer([message], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\n\n# Initialize streamer for real-time token-by-token text output\ntext_streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer)\n\n# Generate text from the model:\n# - streamer: Enables streaming output\n# - max_new_tokens: Limits response length\n# - use_cache: Enables KV-cache for faster generation\n# Result assigned to _ since we only care about streamed output\n_ = model.generate(**inputs, streamer=text_streamer, max_new_tokens=256, use_cache=True)\nExample of inference output looks like this:\n\n\n\nInference Output Example\n\n\n9. Save and Push to Hugging Face Hub\nNow, if we are satisfied with the fine-tuned model’s performance, it’s time to log in and push it to the Hugging Face Hub for later use.\nfrom huggingface_hub import login\n# Log in to the Hugging Face Hub\nlogin(token=userdata.get('HF_TOKEN'))\n\nmodel.save_pretrained_merged(\"model\", tokenizer, save_method=\"merged_16bit\")\nmodel.push_to_hub_merged(\"tanquangduong/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct-TinyStories\", tokenizer, save_method=\"merged_16bit\")",

LoRA focuses on selective parameter tuning, while QLoRA adds memory-efficient quantization, making it suitable for constrained hardware.\nAdditionally, we utilize the Unsloth framework for efficient and fast fine-tuning, Hugging Face’s TRL for setting up the training process, Comet ML for real-time tracking of fine-tuning experiments, and Hugging Face Hub for dataset and model storage and access.\nWe demonstrated through an example of adapting a custom instruction dataset to fine-tune the Qwen2.5-3B model, resulting in a fine-tuned model that functions as a story generator capable of creating children’s stories based on a simple instruction prompt.",

    "text": "Implementation with LangGraph, OpenAI, MongoDB, Opik (Comet ML)\n\nImporting packages & Loading environment variables\nFirst, we import necessary packages.\n# Import required packages\nimport os\nimport json\nimport requests\nimport opik\nfrom opik import track\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain_core.tools import tool\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nNext, we need to load environment variables, such as API keys, to enable the use of various services. For example: OPENAI_API_KEY for accessing OpenAI GPT models, COMET_API_KEY for utilizing Comet ML’s Opik monitoring service, and CONNECTION_STRING for connecting to MongoDB.\n\n\n\nExample of .env file\n\n\nWe use the load_dotenv function from the dotenv package to securely load our confidential API keys.\nload_dotenv()\n\n\nConnect, Add and Query MongoDB\nLet’s first connect with your MongoDB cluster.\n# Get MongoDB Connection String, database name and collection name\nMONGO_CONNECTION_STRING = os.getenv('CONNECTION_STRING')\nFOOD_DATABASE_NAME = os.getenv('FOOD_DATABASE_NAME')\nFOOD_COLLECTION_NAME = os.getenv('FOOD_COLLECTION_NAME')\n\n# Connect to Mongo\nclient = MongoClient(MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING)\nfood_db = client[FOOD_DATABASE_NAME]\nfood_collection = food_db[FOOD_COLLECTION_NAME]\nImagine you have raw data in JSON format containing image names and their corresponding URLs. We load this data into a dictionary.\n\nGet the raw data\ndata_path = './data/food_db.json'\nwith open(data_path, 'r') as file:\n    food_dict = json.load(file)\nprint(food_dict)\nThe raw data is structured as follows:\n{'Figure 1': 'https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1ODozOIYAjChN_oZoSFxUqGaAlNMeKYya&export=view&authuser=0',\n 'Figure 2': 'https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1bxNoQ0ORvvA1Ywnijq3mCmlH4kp5Az96&export=view&authuser=0'}\n\n\nAdd item to Mongo DB\nNext, we insert each item from the above data dictionary into our food_photos data collection.\n# Iterate and upload to MongoDB\nfor image_name, image_uri in food_dict.items():\n    food_collection.insert_one({'image_name': image_name, 'image_uri': image_uri})\n\n\n\nFood Photo DB on MongoDB\n\n\n\n\nQuery an item from Mongo DB\nThe following example demonstrates how to retrieve an image URI from our MongoDB collection using an image name, and then display the image.\nimport requests\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\n\n# Querying image_uri by image_name\nimage_name = \"Figure 1\"\nitem = food_collection.find_one({'image_name': image_name})\nimage_url = item['image_uri']\n\n# Plot image\nresponse = requests.get(image_url)\nimage_data = response.content\ndisplay(Image(data=image_data))\n\n\n\nExample of querying image_uri\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate OpenAI LLM and Opik clients\nIn the next step, we initialize the OpenAI LLM model and the Opik client, which serve as the core AI model and the AI monitoring service, respectively.\n# Initial OpenAI model, i.e. gpt-4o or gpt-4o-mini\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o\")\n\n# Initiate Opik client for LLM and prompt monitoring and management\nopik_client = opik.Opik()\n\n\nPromp tracking and management with Opik (Comet ML)\nPrompt engineering significantly impacts LLM performance. Therefore, a dedicated tool for prompt monitoring, versioning, and management is crucial. This practice is a cornerstone of LLMOps best practices. A centralized platform is essential for streamlining prompt monitoring and management while enabling seamless team collaboration.\nFor this vital task, we utilize Comet ML’s Opik to ensure easy-to-use and effectiveness.\nLet’s create our prompt for the agent task on the Opik platform. Alternatively, you can also create it programmatically. See this tutorial from Opik for more information. \nThe prompt for our agent is as bellow.\nYou are a renowned master chef with expertise in analyzing dishes and crafting exquisite recipes. \n\nUpon receiving a photo of a food item, you will provide a detailed description of the dish, including its key characteristics, ingredients, and cultural context if applicable. \n\nThen, you will create a high-quality, easy-to-follow recipe to prepare this dish, ensuring both flavor and presentation are exceptional.\nWhen you create different prompts for various purposes, the Opik’s Prompt Library page should look like this: \n\n\nPrepare prompt for AI Tool\nAfter creating the agent prompt on the Opik platform, we use the Opik Python SDK to retrieve this prompt directly in our source code. We then integrate it into a HumanMessage template from LangChain, enabling its use in the main function of our agentic tool.\nThe prompt and human message preparation are achieved using the following get_prompt function.\nWe use a decorator for this function:\n\n@track: for Opik to track the function’s inputs and outputs.\n\n@track\ndef get_prompt(prompt_name, image_url):\n    # Get prompt that is created on Opik platform\n    prompt_template = opik_client.get_prompt(name=prompt_name)\n    formatted_prompt_template = prompt_template.format()\n\n    # Create Human message\n    human_message = HumanMessage(\n        content=[\n            {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": formatted_prompt_template},\n            {\"type\": \"image_url\", \"image_url\": {\"url\": image_url}},\n        ],\n    )\n    return human_message\nNext, we create the main function, generate_ip_image_description, for our agentic tool. Following the LangGraph agent convention, we include a docstring that describes the task the agent should perform. This function performs several steps:\n\nSpecify the name of the prompt we want to use.\nQuery the image_url from the MongoDB collection using the image_name.\nCreate a human message using the get_prompt function with two input arguments: prompt_name and image_url.\nInvoke the LLM model with the message to generate the response as the image description.\n\nWe apply two decorators to this function:\n\n@tool from LangChain_Core to define this function as an agentic tool.\n@track for Opik to enable tracking of inputs and outputs.\n\n\n\nCreate main function for agentic tool\n@tool\n@track\ndef generate_ip_image_description(image_name):\n    \"\"\"Generate description for an image about food. \n    Call this whenever you need to provide an image description, \n    for example when a customer asks 'Can you describe the Figure 1?'\"\"\"\n    \n    # prompt_name in created Opik prompt library\n    prompt_name = \"food_image_description\"\n\n    # get image_url from mongodb based on image_name\n    item = food_collection.find_one({'image_name': image_name})\n    image_url = item['image_uri']\n\n    # Get human message\n    message = get_prompt(prompt_name, image_url)\n\n    # Get image description from llm\n    response = llm.invoke([message])\n    return response.content\n\n\nAgent {Tools + Prompt + LLM + Memory}\nOnce the tools, LLM, and prompt are ready, we combine these agent components using the create_react_agent function from LangGraph to build our LLM agent. Importantly, to enable our agent chatbot to handle conversations effectively, we integrate memory by using MemorySaver from LangGraph.\n# Use`generate_ip_image_description` as tools for function calling\ntools = [generate_ip_image_description]\n\n# Global prompt for agent\nprompt = (\n    \"You are a helpful assistant. \"\n    \"You may not need to use tools for every query - the user may just want to chat!\"\n)\n\n# Agent memory\nmemory = MemorySaver()\n\n# Create Agent\nagent = create_react_agent(llm, tools, state_modifier=prompt, checkpointer=memory)",

By using DPO with the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) technique, we can leverage efficient finetuning by only modifying a small subset of the model’s parameters. This keeps training costs low while maintaining flexibility in the model’s outputs."

    "text": "When building an LLM-based agentic chatbot for production, several design patterns and elements should be considered: Guardrails: Implement safety controls to monitor and dictate user interactions with the LLM application. This ensures the AI model operates within defined principles and organizational guidelines2. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS): Utilize a system of specialized LLM agents for different tasks, such as a reflector, document checker, web searcher, critic, and coder. This approach can improve performance and accuracy compared to a single chatbot3. Agentic Design Patterns: Supervision: Use a Supervisor (Router) agent to manage Worker/Specialist agents4. Reflection: Prompt the LLM to critique its past actions for improvement4. Collaboration: Enable agents to share common memories and work together as specialists4. Agent Components: Planner: Creates step-by-step plans by decomposing complex tasks4. Memory: Stores conversation history and learned context4. Tools: Enables the agent to call external APIs or functions4. Specialization: Focus on building specialized agents for specific tasks rather than general-purpose ones. This approach often leads to better performance and reliability4. Evaluation Pipeline: Implement a proper evaluation system with clearly defined goals to assess and improve agent performance4. Rate Limiting: As you mentioned, implement rate limiting to manage API calls and prevent overuse or abuse of the system. Composability: Design agents as functions that can be combined and reused in various configurations5. Error Handling and Fallbacks: Implement robust error handling mechanisms and fallback options for when the LLM fails to provide satisfactory responses. Scalability: Design the system to handle increasing loads and user interactions efficiently. Monitoring and Logging: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging systems to track performance, errors, and user interactions. Privacy and Security: Ensure proper data handling, encryption, and compliance with relevant regulations. By considering these design patterns and elements, you can create a more robust, efficient, and reliable LLM-based agentic chatbot for production use."

This is where guardrails come in handy. As they act as safety measures to ensure the chatbot handles both user input and its own responses correctly.\nIn this article, we explore the motivation behind implementing guardrails in a domain-specific chatbot, such as one for food and dish recommendation, the types of guardrails available, trade-offs involved, asynchronous programming for reducing latency, and the importance of adhering to the SOLID principles in code design.

    "text": "Guardrails in Domain-Specific Chatbots\nIn domain-specific chatbots, without strong safeguards (called guardrails), the chatbot might give irrelevant, incorrect, or insensitive responses, which could frustrate users and harm its credibility. For instance, a chatbot that fails to recognize domain boundaries may provide information outside its scope or respond insensitively to user input, leading to dissatisfaction or reputational harm.\nIn our use-case, for a chatbot focused on food and dish recommendations, the guardrails address issues like out-of-scope topics, culturally insensitive suggestions or ignoring dietary restrictions. Here’s how these safeguards work:\n\nRelevance: The chatbot sticks to food and dish recommendations, avoiding topics outside its expertise to ensure helpful and accurate responses.\nAppropriateness: Responses are respectful of cultural norms and dietary preferences. For example:\n\nMedical Restrictions: For a diabetic diet, it avoids recommending foods high in sugar or carbs.\nVegetarian Choices: No meat suggestions, but includes options with dairy or eggs, if acceptable.\nCultural Sensitivity: For traditional Asian diets, it prioritizes rice-based dishes with vegetables, fish, and soy, while limiting dairy.\n\n\nThese guardrails ensure the chatbot provides a positive user experience and is seen as a reliable and trustworthy helper in its specific area.",

For example, building food-specific scoring that can evaluate responses based on criteria such as cultural sensitivity or dietary appropriateness.\nSyntax Checks: Checking errors and inconsistencies in output’s format to make sure that the outputs are suitable for downstream tasks like easy-to-read for answering question or corrected schema format for ‘arguments’ in function calling task.\n\nThese guardrails work together to create a robust system, improving user trust and the overall experience with the chatbot.",

This is particularly beneficial for systems that deal with I/O-bound operations, such as network requests or database queries, as it prevents blocking the main execution thread while waiting for responses.\nIn the context of a food and dish recommendation chatbot, asynchronous programming allows input guardrails and output generation task to run in parallel, significantly reducing overall latency. For example, while the chatbot processes a user query for moderation, input validation tasks can execute simultaneously, ensuring both operations are completed efficiently without delay.\nIn general, this concurrency is critical in delivering fast, real-time responses to users, enhancing the chatbot’s usability and user experience.

Without a structured approach, changes to the codebase could lead to unnecessary complexity, higher maintenance costs, and bugs.\nThis is where SOLID principles come in handy. The principles ensure that our codebase is modular, easy to understand, and adaptable to future changes without requiring extensive rewrites.\n\nAdhering to SOLID Principles for Scalability and Maintainability\nTo implement input and output guardrails effectively, we break the chatbot system into distinct classes: OpenAIClient, Guardrail, and ChatbotHandler, each adhering to SOLID principles and designed to work seamlessly with asynchronous programming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayground in Colab\n\n\n\nThe full Colab notebook can be found here.\n\n\nBefore we jump into the function/class implementation, let’s installing and importing necessary packages:\n# !pip install openai==1.55.0 python-dotenv==1.0.1\nimport asyncio\nimport openai\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nload_dotenv()\n\nOpenAIClient class\n\nThis class acts as the interface to interact with the OpenAI API, handling message formatting and API calls.\nIt uses asynchronous programming to make non-blocking requests to the API, ensuring the chatbot can handle multiple user queries efficiently. This follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) as it focuses solely on managing API interactions.\nBy following the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), this class can be replaced with another implementation (e.g., another LLM client) without affecting the rest of the system.\nclass OpenAIClient:\n    def __init__(self, model: str):\n        self.model = model\n\n    async def get_response(self, messages, temperature=0.5):\n        try:\n            response = openai.chat.completions.create(\n                model=self.model, messages=messages, temperature=temperature\n            )\n            return response.choices[0].message.content\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Error getting response: {e}\")\n            return None\n\nGuardrail class\n\nThis class encapsulates the logic for input and output guardrails.

Adhering to the SOLID principles ensures that the chatbot’s architecture remains scalable and maintainable as requirements evolve.\nBy integrating input and output guardrails thoughtfully, as demonstrated in the code snippets, we can build reliable and user-friendly chatbots that excel in delivering high-quality interactions.",
