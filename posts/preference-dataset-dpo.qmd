## Introduction
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a technique used to align AI-generated outputs with human preferences by optimizing language models. To achieve this, a preference dataset is required, containing data that enables models to understand which responses are preferred by humans and which are not. In this article, we'll walk through a code implementation to create such a dataset using Python, OpenAI's API, and Hugging Face's Datasets library.

## Components of a Preference Dataset for DPO
A preference dataset typically includes:

Prompts: Inputs or questions given to the AI model.
Chosen Responses: AI-generated responses preferred by human evaluators.
Rejected Responses: Less preferred responses or responses not selected by human evaluators.
By providing this structure, the dataset allows a model to learn which responses are preferable, making it better aligned with human preferences.

## Our use-case
In [our previous post](https://tanquangduong.github.io/posts/instruction-dataset-sft.html), we created an instruction dataset, [TinyStories_Instruction](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tanquangduong/TinyStories_Instruction), from the raw [TinyStories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories) dataset. This dataset was specifically designed for fine-tuning a pretrained Large/Small Language Model using LORA/QLORA to develop a story generator tailored to 5-year-olds.

In this guide, we take the next step by creating a preference dataset from the previously generated instruction dataset. This dataset is used for fine-tuning a pretrained Large/Small Language Model through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enhancing our story generator to align even better with human preferences and produce engaging, age-appropriate content for young children.

The process for creating a preference dataset is illustrated below:

## Implementation
This implementation involves a series of steps: extracting data, generating AI responses, and creating preference triplets.

```python
import concurrent.futures
import json
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from typing import List, Tuple
from datasets import Dataset, load_dataset, concatenate_datasets
from openai import OpenAI
from tqdm.auto import tqdm
from google.colab import userdata
```
**1. Data Extraction Function**

The `extract_ground_instruction_story` function extracts pairs of instructions and desired outputs from a given dataset.
```python
def extract_ground_instruction_story(dataset):
	return [(example['instruction'], example['output']) for example in dataset]
```
**2. Creating a PreferenceSet Class**

The `PreferenceSet` class manages and stores the triples of (instruction, generated story, desired story).

```python
class PreferenceSet:
	def __init__(self, triples: List[Tuple[str, str, str]]):
		self.triples = triples

	@classmethod
	def from_json(cls, json_str: str, instruction, desired_story) -> 'PreferenceSet':
		data = json.loads(json_str)
		triples = [(instruction, data['generated_story'], desired_story)]
		return cls(triples)

	def __iter__(self):
		return iter(self.triples)
```
**3. Generating Preference-Response Triplets**

This function generates a story using OpenAI's API and returns a preference triple in the format (instruction, generated response, desired response).

```python
def generate_preference_answer_triples(instruction: str, desired_story: str, client: OpenAI) -> List[Tuple[str, str, str]]:
	prompt = f"""Based on the following instruction, generate a story. \
		Story should be no longer than 50 words. Story uses several complex words or structures \
		that are not suitable for 5-year-olds.

		Provide your response in JSON format with the following structure:
		{{"generated_story": "..."}}

		Instruction:
		{instruction}
		"""
	completion = client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4o-mini",
													messages=[
														{"role": "system",
														"content": "You are a helpful assistant who \
														generates story based on the given instruction. \
														Provide your response in JSON format.",},
														{"role": "user", "content": prompt},
														],
													response_format={"type": "json_object"},
													max_tokens=512,
													temperature=0.2,)
	result = PreferenceSet.from_json(completion.choices[0].message.content, instruction, desired_story)

	# Convert to list of tuples
	return result.triples
```
**4. Creating the Preference Dataset**

This function creates a dataset using the extracted stories and generated responses.

```python
def create_preference_dataset(dataset: Dataset, client: OpenAI, num_workers: int = 4) -> Dataset:
	stories = extract_ground_instruction_story(dataset)
	instruction_answer_triples = []

	with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_workers) as executor:
		futures = [executor.submit(generate_instruction_answer_triples, instruction, desired_story, client) for instruction, desired_story in stories]

		for future in tqdm(concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures), total=len(futures)):
		instruction_answer_triples.extend(future.result())

	instructions, rejected_story, chosen_story = zip(*instruction_answer_triples)
	return Dataset.from_dict({
		"prompt": list(instructions),
		"rejected": list(rejected_story),
		"chosen": list(chosen_story)
		})
```
**5. The `main` function**

This function initializes the OpenAI client, loads the dataset, creates a preference dataset, and uploads it to the Hugging Face Hub.

```python
def main() -> Dataset:
	client = OpenAI(api_key=userdata.get('OPENAI_API_KEY'))

	# 1. Load the raw data
	# Load the train and test splits
	train_dataset = load_dataset("tanquangduong/TinyStories_Instruction", split="train")
	test_dataset = load_dataset("tanquangduong/TinyStories_Instruction", split="test")

	# Combine the datasets
	raw_dataset = concatenate_datasets([train_dataset, test_dataset])

	print("Raw dataset:")
	print(raw_dataset.to_pandas())

	# 2. Create preference dataset
	preference_dataset = create_preference_dataset(raw_dataset, client)
	print("Preference dataset:")
	print(preference_dataset.to_pandas())

	# 3. Train/test split and export
	filtered_dataset = preference_dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.1)
	filtered_dataset.push_to_hub("tanquangduong/TinyStories_Preference")
```
**6. Hugging Face Hub Login**

To authenticate with Hugging Face and run the pipeline:

```python
from huggingface_hub import login
# Log in to the Hugging Face Hub
login(token=userdata.get('HF_TOKEN'))

# Launch the pipeline to create instruction dataset
main()
```
## Conclusion
The article outlines the process of creating a Preference Dataset for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align AI-generated outputs with human preferences. It focuses on enhancing a story-generation model for 5-year-olds by building on a previously created instruction dataset. The dataset consists of prompts, human-preferred responses, and rejected responses, allowing the model to learn desired behavior. Key steps include extracting instruction-output pairs, generating AI responses using OpenAI's API, and organizing the data into preference triplets. The final dataset, prepared for fine-tuning, is uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub, improving the AI's ability to produce engaging, age-appropriate content.
