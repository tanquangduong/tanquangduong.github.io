Creating a tailored instruction dataset for fine-tuning a language model is a critical step in enhancing the model's capabilities for specialized tasks. This guide provides a step-by-step example of how to create an instruction dataset.

Before starting, it is essential to define the dataset's intended purpose. Are you developing a chatbot, a story generator, or a question-answering system? Clearly understanding the desired model behavior will guide the type and structure of the data you prepare.

In this guide, our goal is to create an instruction dataset suitable for fine-tuning a pretrained Large/Small Language Model to produce a story generator dedicated for 5-year-olds.

## Use Case
Let's examine our use-case for this guide.

The raw dataset [TinyStories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories), introduced in the paper [TinyStories: How Small Can Language Models Be and Still Speak Coherent English?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759) by Ronen Eldan and Yuanzhi Li. This dataset consists of short, synthetically generated stories created by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with a limited vocabulary, making it highly suitable for our intended 5-year-old readers. The dataset is divided into two splits: train (2.12M rows) and validation (22K rows). For this use case, we will use the train split with 10K rows.

Below is a sample view of the TinyStories dataset on the Hugging Face Dataset Hub:

To create the instruction dataset, we will generate synthetic instruction sentences that correspond to each story in the TinyStories dataset.

## Implementation
### 1. Load Required Packages
Let's begin by loading the necessary packages.

```python
import concurrent.futures
import json
import re
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from typing import List, Tuple
from datasets import Dataset, load_dataset, concatenate_datasets
from openai import OpenAI
from tqdm.auto import tqdm
from google.colab import userdata
```
### 2. Define Modular Functions
Next, we define key functions to structure our pipeline.

**Extracting Stories**
The `get_story_list` function creates a list of stories from the raw dataset:
```python
def get_story_list(dataset):
	return [example['text'] for example in dataset]
```
**Managing Instruction-Answer Pairs**

The `InstructionAnswerSet` class defines a structure to store and manage instruction-answer pairs, with methods to create instances from JSON and iterate over pairs:

```python
class InstructionAnswerSet:
	def __init__(self, pairs: List[Tuple[str, str]]):
		self.pairs = pairs

	@classmethod
	def from_json(cls, json_str: str, story: str) -> 'InstructionAnswerSet':
		data = json.loads(json_str)
		pairs = [(data['instruction_answer'], story)]
		return cls(pairs)

	def __iter__(self):
		return iter(self.pairs)
```
**Generating Instruction-Answer Pairs**

The `generate_instruction_answer_pairs` function takes a story and an OpenAI client as inputs to generate instruction-answer pairs using GPT-4. The function crafts a prompt to create relevant instructions while adhering to specific formatting requirements:
```python
def generate_instruction_answer_pairs(story: str, client: OpenAI) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:
	prompt = f"""Based on the following story, generate an one-sentence instruction. Instruction \
		must ask to write about a content the story.
		Only use content from the story to generate the instruction. \
		Instruction must never explicitly mention a story. \
		Instruction must be self-contained and general. \

		Example story: Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. \
		Lily liked to pretend she was a popular princess. She lived in a big castle \
		with her best friends, a cat and a dog. One day, while playing in the castle, \
		Lily found a big cobweb. The cobweb was in the way of her fun game. \
		She wanted to get rid of it, but she was scared of the spider that lived there. \
		Lily asked her friends, the cat and the dog, to help her. They all worked together to clean the cobweb. \
		The spider was sad, but it found a new home outside. Lily, the cat, and \
		the dog were happy they could play without the cobweb in the way. \
		And they all lived happily ever after.
		
		Example instruction: Write a story about a little girl named Lily who, \
		with the help of her cat and dog friends, overcomes her fear of a spider to \
		clean a cobweb in their castle, allowing everyone to play happily ever after. \

		Provide your response in JSON format with the following structure:
		{{"instruction_answer": "..."}}
		Story:
		{story}
		"""
	completion = client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4o-mini",
                                                messages=[
													{"role": "system",
                                                    "content": "You are a helpful assistant who \
                                                    generates instruction based on the given story. \
                                                    Provide your response in JSON format.",},
													{"role": "user", "content": prompt},
                                                    ],
                                                response_format={"type": "json_object"},
                                                max_tokens=1200,
                                                temperature=0.7,)
	result = InstructionAnswerSet.from_json(completion.choices[0].message.content, story)
	# Convert to list of tuples
	return result.pairs
```

**Creating the Instruction Dataset**

We now wrap the previous functions into a final function `create_instruction_dataset`:
```python
def create_instruction_dataset(dataset: Dataset, client: OpenAI, num_workers: int = 4) -> Dataset:
	stories = extract_substory(dataset)
	instruction_answer_pairs = []

	with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_workers) as executor:
		futures = [executor.submit(generate_instruction_answer_pairs, story, client) for story in stories]

		for future in tqdm(concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures), total=len(futures)):
			instruction_answer_pairs.extend(future.result())

	instructions, answers = zip(*instruction_answer_pairs)
	return Dataset.from_dict({"instruction": list(instructions), "output": list(answers)})
```
### 3. Orchestrating the Pipeline

Nest, the `main` function orchestrates the entire pipeline, which includes:

	+ Initialize the OpenAI client
	+ Load the raw TinyStories dataset
	+ Create instruction dataset
	+ Perform train/test split
	+ Push the processed dataset to Hugging Face Hub

```python
def main() -> Dataset:
	# Initializes the OpenAI client
	client = OpenAI(api_key=userdata.get('OPENAI_API_KEY'))

	# Load the raw data
	raw_dataset = load_dataset("roneneldan/TinyStories", split="train[:10000]")

	# Create instructiondataset
	instruction_dataset = create_instruction_dataset(raw_dataset, client)

	# Train/test split and export
	filtered_dataset = instruction_dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.1)

	# Push the processed dataset to Hugging Face Hub
	filtered_dataset.push_to_hub("tanquangduong/TinyStories_Instruction")
```
### 4. Authenticating and Running the Pipeline

Then, we authenticate with the Hugging Face Hub for later dataset uploading and execute the pipeline.

```python
from huggingface_hub import login
# Log in to the Hugging Face Hub
login(token=userdata.get('HF_TOKEN'))

# Launch the pipeline to create instruction dataset
main()
```
## Resulting Instruction Dataset 

After running the above pipeline, the resulting instruction dataset will look like this:

## Conclusion

In summary, this guide demonstrated the creation of an instruction dataset tailored for fine-tuning. We first defined the purpose of fine-tuning and structured the dataset accordingly. By leveraging GPT-4, we generated instructions for each story using best practices in prompt engineering, including precise instructions, a one-shot example, and a specified output format. Finally, the processed dataset was uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub for future use.
